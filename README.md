# Tsuro
A Tsuro boardgame

Description: A game of Tsuro to be played against a computer player.

Concept Map
Build functional movement of tiles and pieces > Build most basic AI > Advance AI slowly

Optional:
If we finish early do we want to fully clone the whole project and begin implementation of multiplayer?

Notes:
Display should be able to show the board, show the figures on the board, and show the cards in your hand as the most 
basic functions.  Other areas to consider are displaying the AI's cards in hand, or at the very least the number of cards.
Perhaps a basic visualization of the deck with a number of cards left next. It could be static, or perhaps we could have 
multiple pics for different stack sizes (0, 1-10, etc).

Can we even do sound?

    LibGDX has sound/audio libraries so it may be possible.

Probably want to save for last though.
